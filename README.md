# Practise Questions
This is just a repository to hold all my practise questions. It will have questions from multiple languages, technologies or anything else that may be helpful for me to come back to in the future.

## Contributing
I am not looking for contributions, however if something can be improved in my repository, feel free to create an issue on GitHub.
