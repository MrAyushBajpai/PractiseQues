    /*
        Strict Comparators allow for checking only if both the operands are the same data type. It's much safer, and generally recommended.
        Loose Comparators allow for checking different data types, where the operator has to guess what's being compared.
        Ex:- 10 == "10" -> true: string "10" is converted to int 10
             null == undefined -> true: they are loosely the same by language rule
